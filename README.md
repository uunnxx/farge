## Tips
It would be smart to bind `farge` to a keybinding. Here is an example for `i3wm` users:
```
bindsym $mod+Shift+f --release exec farge
```

If you use a window manager, you can assign rules the windows so they are
always floating. For `i3wm` user, put this in your config:

```
# Let the windows created by Farge be floating
for_window [instance="Farge"] floating enable
```
